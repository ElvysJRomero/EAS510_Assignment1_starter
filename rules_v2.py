"""EAS 510 - Project 1 - Phase 2: the V2 rule set.

Rules 1-3 are kept exactly as in `rules.py`. Your job is to ADD Rule 4 that
targets the systematic weakness you diagnosed from results_v1_hard.txt.

Constraint: the rules' `out_of` weights must still sum to 100 so the Final
Score stays on a /100 scale (the format validator enforces "Final Score:
<s>/100" equals the sum of the block's rule scores).

Example split that keeps the original spirit: Rules 1-3 -> 25/25/40 and
Rule 4 -> 10 (or trim the losers more aggressively).
